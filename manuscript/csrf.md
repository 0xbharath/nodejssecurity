# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Named after the attack it employs, a CSRF tricks the victim to unknowingly send requests to a system where the user has access to, and is presumably already logged-in to. Usually these attacks are targeted by nature as the attacker would have to craft a CSRF and trick the user into performing an action on another system than that of the attacker. Thus, the attacker probably has previous knowledge of the target system for which the CSRF is crafted.
