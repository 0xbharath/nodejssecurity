# Foreword

Node.js, and JavaScript at large are quickly taking over software for the web. StackOverflow[^survey1] and GitHub's[^survey2] projects statistics strengthen this notion, showcasing JavaScript in the IoT industry, ChatOps projects, and general Enterprises adoption is growing as well for Node.js. With this trend in the rise for the past several years, it is imperative to take into account security practices and learn how to secure and harden Node.js Web Applications.

This book aims to equip existing Node.js developers with expertise and skills in security best practices. The book takes a practical hands-on approach to the Node.js ecosystem by using a good deal of source code examples, and demos, as well as reviewing well tested and common libraries and industry security standards.
